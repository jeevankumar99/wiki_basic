# Spa Francorchamps

The _Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps_ is a motor-racing circuit located in Stavelot, Belgium. It is the current venue of the Formula One Belgian Grand Prix,  
 hosting its first Grand Prix in 1925, and has held a Grand Prix every year since 1983

### Track Layout

Designed in 1920 by _Jules de Thier_ and _Henri Langlois Van Ophem_,  
the original course used public roads linking the Belgian towns of Francorchamps, Malmedy, and Stavelot.  
The trackâ€™s inaugural race was planned for August 1921, but was cancelled when only one driver entered.

### Eau Rouge

The most famous part of the circuit is the Eau Rouge and Raidillon combination. Having negotiated the La Source hairpin, drivers race down a straight  
 to the point where the track crosses the Eau Rouge stream for the first time, before being launched steeply uphill into a sweeping left-right-left  
  series of corners with a blind summit. Properly speaking, the Eau Rouge corner is only the left-hander at the bottom. The following right-hander  
   that leads steeply uphill, which was introduced in 1939 to shortcut the original Ancienne Douane hairpin, is called Raidillon [fr]. The corner   
   requires an amount of skill from the driver to negotiate it well and the long Kemmel straight ahead produces good overtaking opportunities for  
    drivers at the following "Les Combes" corner. The corner was tighter and narrower before 1970, allowing drivers to take the corner faster.
